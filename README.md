# Big-Mac-Price-and-Net-Hourly-Wage-Analysis
This repository contains an analysis of the relationship between the price of a Big Mac and net hourly wages across different regions, based on a dataset. The goal is to build a model that can predict net hourly wages of workers based on the price of a Big Mac using linear regression and evaluate the model’s performance.
Project Overview
In this analysis, we explore whether there is a statistical relationship between the Big Mac price and the net hourly wage of workers. The model aims to predict hourly wages using the price of a Big Mac as the main predictor. We will evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as R-squared, Sum of Squares for Regression (SSR), and Sum of Squares for Error (SSE).
Key Findings
R-squared (R²): The linear regression model has an R-squared value of 0.6616 (66.16%), indicating that 66.16% of the variation in net hourly wages is explained by the Big Mac price.
The model shows a moderate-to-strong relationship between Big Mac prices and net hourly wages, but further improvements could be made by including other variables.
