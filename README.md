# Big-Mac-Price-and-Net-Hourly-Wage-Analysis
This repository contains an analysis of the relationship between the price of a Big Mac and net hourly wages across different regions, based on a dataset. The goal is to build a model that can predict net hourly wages of workers based on the price of a Big Mac using linear regression and evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.
